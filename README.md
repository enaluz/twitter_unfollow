# Rationale
I wanted to unfollow everyone on Twitter. I was too lazy to unfollow everyone manually, but not too lazy to write some lines of Javascript!

# Usage
Go to `https://twitter.com/<username>/following`. Open devtools console, and paste the contents of `unfollow.js`. Type `unfollow()`, press enter, and watch your follow list quickly shrink to 0!
