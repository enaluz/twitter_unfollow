# Rationale
I wanted to unfollow everyone on Twitter. I was too lazy to unfollow everyone manually, but not too lazy to write some lines of Javascript!

# Usage
Go to `https://twitter.com/<username>/following`. Open devtools console, and paste the contents of `unfollow.js`. Type `unfollow()`, press enter, and watch your follow list quickly shrink to 0! *You may have to run it once or twice in case it reaches a broken state (give me a break, I wrote this in like 8 minutes at 12 AM).

# Other Uses
Sorry, it can't get rid of people in real life. It only works on Twitter for now (v2 coming soon though).
